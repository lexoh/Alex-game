First, you'll need to install Steghide on your computer. You can download the latest version of Steghide from its official website (https://steghide.sourceforge.io/download.php).

Once Steghide is installed, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the image file and the file you want to hide are located.

To hide a file within an image, use the following command:

Copy code
steghide embed -cf <image_file> -ef <file_to_hide>
Replace <image_file> with the name of the image file, and <file_to_hide> with the name of the file you want to hide.

Steghide will prompt you to enter a passphrase to encrypt the hidden file. Choose a strong passphrase and enter it when prompted.

Steghide will now embed the file within the image. The image file will not change in size, but it will contain the hidden file.

To extract the hidden file from the image, use the following command:

Copy code
steghide extract -sf <image_file>
Enter the passphrase you used to hide the file when prompted, and Steghide will extract the hidden file from the image.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
